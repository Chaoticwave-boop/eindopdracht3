        <p id="description">
            The player takes the role of a Hunter, 
            slaying or trapping large monsters across various landscapes as part of quests given to them by locals, 
            with some quests involving the gathering of a certain item or items, 
            which may put the Hunter at risk of facing various monsters. 
            you have a couple diffrent monster hunter games but personally i like
            monster hunter world the most, the graphics and playstyle fits me the best.
            i like playing with the hammer cus hammer goes bonk and bonk is good.
            other weapons are cool 2 like the switchblade and dual blades.
