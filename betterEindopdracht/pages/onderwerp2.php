            Elden Ring is an action role-playing game played in a third person perspective, 
            with gameplay focusing on combat and exploration. 
            It features elements similar to those found in other games developed by FromSoftware, 
            such as the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. 
            My first playthrough of elden ring was alot of fun since then ive played through the game
            and beat it over 6 times! trying diffrent builds is fun and can be a bit of a challange
            if your not used to the playstyle. also fire giant, that knight with the shield and god skin duo
            are my least favorite, my favorite are melenia, maliketh and rykard. sorry if i miss spelled some of them
            their names are diffucult.
