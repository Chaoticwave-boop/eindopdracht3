        <p id="description">
            Super Mario 64 is a 3D platformer in which the player controls Mario through various courses.
            Mario's abilities are far more diverse than in previous games.
            He can walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, climb, swim, kick, grab objects, 
            and punch using the game controller's analog stick and buttons.
            ive played this game when i was very young and played it alot.
            got frusttraded about it too. but even looking back at the game now
            ive had alot of good memories of it. finding yoshi and playing as the mini 
            dinosaur was fantastic but i hated those sliding levels and the underwater stuff.
            as a child i remember that underwater bastard very clear and had some nightmares about it.
            not anymore tho although it still makes my skin crawl.
